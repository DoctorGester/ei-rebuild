# Cleanup phase 1: units (cleanup plan, ticket C2u)

How the unit family is declared after the cleanup (`unit*.h` / `unit_*.cpp`, without `unit_create_stats.cpp`) and what
is still left. The units themselves are in `units.md`; the conventions are those of `cleanup-engine-base.md` and
`cleanup-map-objects.md`. Every rewritten address kept its hook and verify wrapper.

## Declarations

- `CUnit : CMapObject` (novtable, `kVtableAddress` 0073EA8C). The layouts agreed at every offset, so CUnit's copies of
  +0x000..+0x237 are gone:
  - the prototype name is `CObject3D::name`, the figure's build `scale.y`, the old `animationCC` `scale.z`, the model
    height `defaultScale`, `animation1B4` `baseScale.z`;
  - hit points and mana are `CMapObject::packedVitals` (`UnitVitalsPacked` moved to map_object.h), the effects are
    `MapEffect` records;
  - `MarkChanged` and `HasEffect` are CMapObject's (rewritten in map_object.cpp); `MapObject()` is the upcast.
- CUnit's bodies of slots 18-51 are overrides (AdvanceTime, SetStunned, AcceptsAnimation, RecomputeScale,
  EffectsChanged, ApplyBaseScale, LoadFigures, AttachObject, StatsChanged, ScaleEffectChanged, SetStats,
  UpdateSizeClasses, PlaceOnGround, TakePrototype), each registered through a `...Hook` shim; calls that meant the body
  are qualified. `StandPoint` is not an override (it takes `float*`, the slot `Vector3*`).
- `CUnitController` slots 36 / 37 return `bool` (AL); slot 33 (`SetWeaponModels`) returns EAX, which SendEquipment
  passes on.
- Field names: `scriptName` is an `mfc::CString`; +0x254..+0x260 `animationEntry`, `secondEntry`, `actionSound`,
  `animationStart`, `motionMode`, `pathTimeShift` (setters SetAnimationEntries / SetMotionMode / SetPathTimeShift);
  +0x270 `pendingWeapon`; +0x328 `unitRadius`; +0x4B0 `actionSpeeds[6]` (from `UnitModelRecord::actionSpeeds`).
- 005327D0 is `CUnit::ActionSpeed(const FigureAnimation*)`: it reads the entry's key (bits 18-21, the action kind), not
  a hit's damage type, so it is no longer ResistanceTo.
- `SkillLevelRecord::Value()` (the exact FILD load of values[7]; three copies merged) and `WorthExponent()` (values[6]).
- Duplicates merged: unit_save's ChangePlayer is `CUnit::SetPlayer`; the level value loads above.

## Counts (unit family, before / after)

Offset access 44 / 0, VCall 22 / 0, *At views 0 / 0, `unknown_` names 400 / 340, byte offset arithmetic 23 / 15.

## Left

- `CUnit::player` is still `char*` (CPlayer, about 145 uses, with `PartyRecords` at +0x70 reached by arithmetic).
- `UnitStream` duplicates `CStream` (about 110 uses); unit_save converts with `AsStream`.
- `UnitParams` could be embedded at +0x330 (it is exactly 0x108 bytes up to +0x438); CUnit's `attackRate`,
  `movementKind`, `modeSpeeds`, `baseSpeed` repeat it and `bodyParts` is a view of its slots shifted by 0x14 (the
  maximum is unsigned there, signed in the slot), so the merge needs care.
- `carried` (+0x49C..+0x4AF) and PartyUnitRecord's four item lists could be `mfc::CArray`.
- `UnequipArmour` / `ReleaseAllItems` call controller slot 27 by hand: the original reads the vtable before evaluating
  the argument, which a virtual call would reorder.
- Item fields used as floats through the item family's names: condition `CItem::unknown_20` / `unknown_24` (unit_hits'
  `ItemFloat`, `IsBroken`), count `unknown_48`, spell cost `CSpell::unknown_40`; `UnitPrototypeRecord::unknown_24` is
  a height (compared with 1.5 for size class 0). They belong to their families' tickets.
- `CMapObjectManager` (unit_create.h) reads its world at +0xAC by hand.
- Unknowns still unnamed in CUnit: `unknown_438` (copied to the party record's +0x780), `unknown_43C` (cell flag 0x80),
  `unknown_278` (slot 54, "large unit").
- `CObject3D : CTransformObject` was left (the shared fields have other names: a large rename).
